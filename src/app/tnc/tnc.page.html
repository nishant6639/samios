Through Samanta Business Accounts, businesses can create and manage collaborative Business Accounts in which Team Members may share Orders, use a shared payment method, track orders , and consolidate feedback—all in one place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">

The Client shall be the sole and exclusive owner of the Business Account including any data, Orders and deliveries. In case of a dispute regarding the identity of the Client, Samanta&nbsp; reserves the right to determine the identity of the Client at its sole discretion, whether or not an independent investigation has been conducted by us. However, if we cannot make such determination (as we may deem in our sole discretion), we reserve the right to avoid doing so and/or suspend the Business Account, without liability to you or to any other party.
